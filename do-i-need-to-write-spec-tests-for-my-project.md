### DO I HAVE TO WRITE TESTS FOR MY PROJECT?

Short answer:

Unless specifically stated in the `spec.md` file, the answer is no, you don't have to write tests for your portfolio projects.

Long answer:

Practicing writing tests can be a highly useful exercise.  We don't focus heavily on the writing aspect of tests in this curriculum, although most labs, of course, contain tests.  Practice reading those tests in each lab, and you'll start to get a feel for how to write them.  Writing tests will improve your skills and add another tool to your belt -- one that might make you stand out in a job interview.
