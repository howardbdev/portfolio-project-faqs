### HOW MUCH TIME SHOULD I SPEND ON STYLING MY APPLICATION?

Short answer:

Don't worry too much about CSS.  As soon as your app meets requirements, schedule your assessment.  Good idea to add enough style to make it look presentable, but that's up to you.

Long answer:

CSS is not the focus of this particular curriculum.  Yes, it's important, but right now our goal is that you learn to build clean, robust applications that work.  Better that you have a black and white, style-free app that works and that you can explain than to have a beautifully styled app that doesn't meet requirements, doesn't work, or that you don't understand.

That said, once your app is functional and meets requirements, feel free to go nuts with style!  How much or how little you wish to style your app depends on you!  How fast do you want to move through the course?  Whether it's worth the time investment is up to you.  It won't affect whether you move along in the course.  We're assessing your back end not your front end (unless you're in JS, then we're assessing your front end, too, but still not so much your style).  Remember you can always go back and brush up/style up your portfolio projects once you've completed the curriculum.

**Regardless of your timing goals, your understanding is far more important than speed.**  Sprinting through the course without properly absorbing and digesting the material won't do anyone any good.  We want you to master the concepts and be a "no-brainer" hire when you're looking for a developer job.  _That's_ our goal.  So you _must_ take the time you need to understand the course material as you go along.

The suggestions here about not spending too much time with styling are framed within the following context:
  a.  most students want to complete the course ASAP
  b.  you can go back and style up your apps in the future, especially once you've learned a ton more material (including JavaScript)
  c.  once you've completed your Rails and JS projects, you'll have a better perspective about which projects you want to highlight to interviewers

None of these means that you _can't_ or _shouldn't_ style up your app!!  If you don't mind taking the time to do it, then go for it - 100%!!  When you do take the time to style an app, you'll learn invaluable CSS lessons.  So if you have the time to do it, and you want to, then go for it!  It's just not required for the project in terms of your assessment.
